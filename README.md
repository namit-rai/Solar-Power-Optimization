# Solar-Power-Optimization

The increasing demand for renewable energy sources has positioned solar power as a critical component in the global energy mix. However, frequent fluctuations in energy output caused by variable environmental conditions—such as changes in sunlight intensity, temperature, and cloud cover—combined with system inefficiencies, are significantly limiting the optimal generation of solar power.

To address this challenge, this project focuses on optimizing solar power production and enhancing system performance.
